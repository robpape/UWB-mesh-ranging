# UWB Mesh Ranging Protocol

## Introduction

The Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Mesh Ranging Protocol is a communication protocol that enables infrastructure-less UWB ranging and exchange of range measurements between a set of UWB-capable nodes, e. g. teams of autonomous robots. 
Its main features include

* automatic creation of an ad-hoc network between nodes in range
* support for dynamic topology changes, i. e. nodes leaving and entering the network during operation
* automatic collision avoidance by employing a TDMA-based channel access method
