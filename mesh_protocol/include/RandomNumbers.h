/** @file RandomNumbers.h
*   @brief Facilitates the generation of random numbers for different purposes
*
*   Can be used to easily get a random slot from a selection of free slots, a random time to schedule a ping etc.
*   The numbers generated are only pseudo-random and are only as good as the RNG that is used to generate them!
*   These functions should not be used for cryptography or similar purposes where a high degree of randomness is important.
