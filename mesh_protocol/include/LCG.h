/** @file LCG.h
*   @brief Implementation of a random number generator (Linear Congruential Generator)
*
*   Reimplementation of rand() as in https://stackoverflow.com/a/10198842 by Matteo Italia
*   Reimplementation was necessary to save the current seed/state of the RNG and thus be able to generate the same sequence of numbers again
*   which is not possible with the rand() function of C. Otherwise it should behave the same (with the same limitations regarding randomness).
*   The state does not need to be saved manually, it is sufficient to create the LCG Struct which will then hold the seed for the node throughout calls
